                    <h3>Case Study 1: PhillyCycle</h3>
                    <p>PhillyCycle operates a bike-sharing service that caters to both casual and registered users across the city. A key factor influencing rental demand is weather, as variations in temperature, humidity, and seasonal changes impact user behavior. This report analyzes the relationship between weather patterns, time variables, and bike rental trends to provide actionable insights for optimizing fleet distribution, pricing strategies, and service availability. Using a comprehensive dataset spanning several years, we identify key differences between casual and registered users, helping PhillyCycle enhance operational efficiency and improve customer satisfaction year-round.</p>

                    <p>IndoCabs operates a digital platform that facilitates cab bookings for various travel needs. A key challenge for the company has been managing cancellations, which disrupt operations and reduce profitability. This report analyzes cancellation patterns and their root causes, focusing on booking windows, trip durations, and customer behavior. Using a comprehensive dataset, we provide insights into how these factors contribute to cancellations and offer targeted recommendations for minimizing cancellations and improving overall service quality.</p>
