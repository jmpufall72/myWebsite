                    <p>PhillyCycle operates a bike-sharing service that caters to both casual and registered users across the city. A key factor influencing rental demand is weather, as variations in temperature, humidity, and seasonal changes impact user behavior. This report analyzes the relationship between weather patterns, time variables, and bike rental trends to provide actionable insights for optimizing fleet distribution, pricing strategies, and service availability. Using a comprehensive dataset spanning several years, we identify key differences between casual and registered users, helping PhillyCycle enhance operational efficiency and improve customer satisfaction year-round.</p>
