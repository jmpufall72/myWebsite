                        <p><em>Chicago, IL | April 2024 – August 2024</em></p>
                        <p>As Divisional Manager for EcoWash’s North Shore operations, I was given full ownership over launching a new division of the company. This wasn’t just a summer internship—it was a chance to build a real business in a new market from scratch. I led every part of the operation: financial management, marketing, recruiting, and project execution.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Created and established a new division of a home exterior maintenance company to expand the business into new regions within the greater Chicago Area; managed all finance and accounting for the division, providing weekly financial reports.</li>
                            <li>Designed and executed a comprehensive marketing strategy, generating over 250 leads, converting 50 clients, and increasing brand visibility through targeted digital and offline campaigns.</li>
                            <li>Crafted extensive project proposals and estimates totaling $500,000 to high-profile property management firms.</li>
                            <li>Recruited and managed a team of three full-time employees, overseeing operations for over 50 projects, ensuring timely and high-quality execution while maintaining client satisfaction and meeting key performance metrics.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This experience taught me how to think like a founder: to stay focused, adapt quickly, and lead with intention. It also reinforced the kind of impact I want to have—building ventures that uplift others, provide value, and are grounded in purpose.</p>

                        <p>
                            Currently, I’m collaborating with Drew Dorenfest on the launch and growth of a digital marketing venture focused on helping brands tell their stories more effectively. While still in its early stages, this initiative is already allowing me to apply my business, branding, and storytelling experience to a creative and entrepreneurial context.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’ve contributed to strategic planning, operations, and web infrastructure, working across multiple client-facing projects while helping shape our brand identity and positioning. The work is fast-paced and rooted in the belief that strong storytelling and intentional design can elevate businesses of all sizes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What I love about this endeavor is that it's not just about marketing—it's about transformation. We're developing creative solutions that help entrepreneurs connect with their audiences in more meaningful ways, and I'm grateful to play a role in building something from the ground up once again.

                    <p>PhillyCycle operates a bike-sharing service that caters to both casual and registered users across the city. A key factor influencing rental demand is weather, as variations in temperature, humidity, and seasonal changes impact user behavior. This report analyzes the relationship between weather patterns, time variables, and bike rental trends to provide actionable insights for optimizing fleet distribution, pricing strategies, and service availability. Using a comprehensive dataset spanning several years, we identify key differences between casual and registered users, helping PhillyCycle enhance operational efficiency and improve customer satisfaction year-round.</p>
